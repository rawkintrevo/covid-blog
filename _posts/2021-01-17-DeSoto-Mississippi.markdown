- *901* new cases of COVID-19
- *19* people have died of COVID-19
- *316* people have recovered from COVID-19[1]

The population in this census area is 184945. By our calculations:
- 9.20% of the population have had COVID-19.[2]
- 1.53% of the population or 2823.0 people are actively fighting the virus.

## Synopsis




[1] Most US CDC offices do give any recovery statistics- we base this on a formula which looks at confirmed new cases
15 days ago (the average recovery time) and deaths over the last 7 days.

[2] Herd Immunity is thought to take effect at around ~70-80%

[3] Due to reporting delays, this data may be incomplete.
