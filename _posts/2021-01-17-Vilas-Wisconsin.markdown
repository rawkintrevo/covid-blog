#### Updated 2021-01-17

## Quick Facts

In the last 7 days[3] we project there have been
- *104* new cases of COVID-19
- *4* people have died of COVID-19
- *9* people have recovered from COVID-19[1]

The population in this census area is 22195. By our calculations:
- 8.52% of the population have had COVID-19.[2]
- 1.14% of the population or 253.0 people are actively fighting the virus.

## Synopsis




[1] Most US CDC offices do give any recovery statistics- we base this on a formula which looks at confirmed new cases
15 days ago (the average recovery time) and deaths over the last 7 days.

[2] Herd Immunity is thought to take effect at around ~70-80%

[3] Due to reporting delays, this data may be incomplete.
