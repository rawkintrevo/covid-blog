#### Updated 2021-01-21

## Quick Facts

In the last 7 days[3] we project there have been
- *224* new cases of COVID-19
- *2* people have died of COVID-19
- *49* people have recovered from COVID-19[1]

The population in this census area is 74470. By our calculations:
- 4.61% of the population have had COVID-19.[2]
- 0.70% of the population or 521.0 people are actively fighting the virus.

## Synopsis




[1] Most US CDC offices do give any recovery statistics- we base this on a formula which looks at confirmed new cases
15 days ago (the average recovery time) and deaths over the last 7 days.

[2] Herd Immunity is thought to take effect at around ~70-80%

[3] Due to reporting delays, this data may be incomplete.
