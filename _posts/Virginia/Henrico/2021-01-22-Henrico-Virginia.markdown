#### Footnotes

[1] Most US CDC offices do give any recovery statistics- we base this on a formula which looks at confirmed new cases
15 days ago (the average recovery time) and deaths over the last 7 days.

[2] Herd Immunity is thought to take effect at around ~70-80%

[3] Due to reporting delays, this data may be incomplete.
