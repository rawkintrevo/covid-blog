#### Updated 2021-01-21

## Quick Facts

In the last 7 days[3] we project there have been
- *28* new cases of COVID-19
- *0* people have died of COVID-19
- *11* people have recovered from COVID-19[1]

The population in this census area is 12797. By our calculations:
- 8.64% of the population have had COVID-19.[2]
- 0.67% of the population or 86.0 people are actively fighting the virus.

## Synopsis




[1] Most US CDC offices do give any recovery statistics- we base this on a formula which looks at confirmed new cases
15 days ago (the average recovery time) and deaths over the last 7 days.

[2] Herd Immunity is thought to take effect at around ~70-80%

[3] Due to reporting delays, this data may be incomplete.
